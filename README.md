## Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
To get started with Empress Shipping, you need to have an API key from your service provider. Each service provider has their own specific doctypes similar to those from the `Integrations` and can be enabled or disabled depending on your needs.

### Installation
Setting up Empress Shipping on your server is straightforward. Follow the steps below:

```sh
cd ~/Empress-bench
bench get-app https://github.com/empress-eco/shipping.git --branch version-14
bench --site $MY_SITE install-app Empress_shipping
```

## Usage
Fetch shipping rates by clicking the `Fetch Shipping Rates` button. Once you've chosen a rate, the shipment will be created for you. The app also allows you to generate shipping labels by clicking on the `Print Shipping Label` on top of the doctype.
